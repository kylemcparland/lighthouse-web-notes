## Week 2: L2 - The Dev Workflow
"If you're getting new errors, you're making progress."

Logic: What have I told the computer exactly to do?
Syntax: Am I missing a curly brace?
Data: Do I have the data I think I do in the format I expect?

Typical research path: 
**Google** the error message/what you want to accomplish + the programming language
**StackOverFlow** is usful for seeing multiple possible solutions to a problem (do NOT copy and paste)
**Mozilla Developer Network** ...read the documentation (90% of what you want to know is on MDN) (W3schools is an alternative in a more beginner friendly language)

Write your code as if the next person who has to read it is a homocidal maniac who has your address.
